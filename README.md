‚ú® Exciting News: Hello everyone! üñêÔ∏è

I'm thrilled to introduce my latest project, Business Insights 360.

### Project Title:  
**AtliQ Hardware: Advanced Data Analytics with Power BI**

### Project Description:
AtliQ Hardware, a leading consumer electronics company, is on a mission to sharpen its competitive edge by harnessing the power of advanced analytics. This project transforms traditional Excel-based reports into dynamic, insightful data solutions using Power BI, SQL, Excel, and DAX Studio. By integrating data from the MySQL database, we've developed a comprehensive dashboard that provides real-time, actionable insights into various departments, including Sales, Finance, Marketing, Executive, Supply Chain, and Logistics.

The dataset includes key dimensions like `dim_product`, `dim_customer`, `dim_market`, and `dim_date`, as well as crucial financial metrics such as `Cogs`, `Freight cost`, `Targets`, and `Fact_actual_estimates`. Our analysis focused on creating vital business metrics, including Net Sales, Gross Margin, Net Profit, Pre and Post Invoice Deductions, COGS, Operational Expenses, Gross Margin %, and identifying the Top 5 Products and Customers.

Through this project, AtliQ Hardware can now make informed decisions across various business units, enhancing overall efficiency and driving strategic growth. The custom-built dashboards for each department serve as powerful tools for tracking performance, identifying trends, and optimizing operations.
